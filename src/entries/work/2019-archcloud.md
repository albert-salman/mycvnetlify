***Technologies***

AWS/Azure/GCP/OCI public clouds, VMware/Openstack private clouds, ServiceNow

***Description***

Various IT governance, architecture, project management and ITSM competencies fall mainly in cloud adoption and hybrid cloud solution architecture, business agility support by means of applying Scaled Agile (SAFe, DaD/LeSS-aware) and Lean (DevOps) practices and methodologies as well as proven EA (TOGAF) and systems engineering (OMG, ISO etc), application modernization (for apps on any stage of SDLC), datacenter optimization and strategy development, disaster recovery / business continuity, information/data management, compliance management (GDPR, J-SOX, NIST, PCI-DSS, HIPAA).

Developing cloud architectures and integration solutions, ensuring solutions deliver functionality to stakeholders, excel in all five non-functional "pillars" (Cost Optimization, Performance Efficiency, Operational Excellence, Reliability, Security) and aligned with overall organization architecture and objectives. Customer engagement, identifying stakeholders across the organization and beyond (internal\external stakeholders and roles), their real needs (not only ones directly communicated, perceiving what is system of interest/using system/enabling system/systems in operating environment etc);

Notable service development projects:

•	Service Architect: Hybrid IT services development (solution support, cloud management, cloud optimization (performance, cost), cloud security, DevOps services);

Notable solution development projects:

•	Cloud Adoption and transformation architect (customer transformation and migration advisory methodology development, Cloud Adoption Framework development based on internal and vendor ones (AWS, Azure, Google), migration blueprint quality review);

•	Lead Architect, migration to Azure cloud (execution of discovery, assessment, planning, architecture and implementation, planning and supervision of migration);

•	Lead Architect, cloud-based data protection and management solution (solution development, service development);

•	Cloud Management Platform reference architecture development and market research/PoC (Hybrid Cloud: Azure Arc (for Servers, for Kubernetes, Data Services, API Management), Google Anthos, AWS Outposts);

•	OpenStack cloud Backup-as-a-Service data protection solution;

•	Traffic monitoring and visualization (ELK, sniffers for different platforms, collectors + open source code customization);

Notable integration projects:

•	Azure Monitor to ServiceNow custom alerting integration using Azure Logic Apps, REST APIs etc;

•   Azure DevOps with ServiceNow Change Management integration for CD (release) pipelines (with plugin customization for own needs);

•	vRealize to ServiceNow alerting integration application developement (MVC app on Python Flask - using incoming and outgoing Web Services (REST APIs), ServiceNow Business Rules and Scheduled Jobs, custom integration watchdog mechanism);
